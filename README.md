# Advanced Mathematics Proof Assistant
Mathematics shouldn't have to be formally verified using complex formal logic and type theory. One of the strongest reasons (I believe) formal verification 
of mathematics proofs (HOL, COQ, Lean etc) is just due to the nature of the complexity of the programming language. My intention is to write a software that 
can parse more human readable mathematics proofs (treating the proofs as a programming language sort of).

This project is a work in progress
